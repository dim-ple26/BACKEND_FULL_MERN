- NPM understanding
* npm : node package manager
   "yahan humko code basis or packages milenge"

   * node js core me jo installed aata hai vo module kehlata hai 

   or 

   * npm se jo hum install krte hai vo hota hai package

* agar hum npm pr jaye to already presettled packages waha pr hai jinhe hum use kr sakte hai 

- installing and uninstalling anything basic and advanced
* install => npm i package name
1. one-liner-joke
   * whenever we install anything that becomes a dependency in our package.json file

* unistall => npm unistall package name
" cannot write u for uninstall"

* insalling particular versions

- Understading node module
   * no lenadena
   * the package we install so the dependecies of that packages sometimes depend upon the source or dependency present in node modules

   * jab hum express instsll krte hai then at that time we see ki humare node modules me no. of files badh jaati hai bcoz humari more dependency files express package ki usme aa jaati hai

- DEpendencies:
  * packages and its dependencies

- devdependencies:
  * those packages which we only use in development and when we made the app and deployed then at that time we are not using that packages


- SCripts:
  defult scripts start test work krti hai already npm start commands hai

  or hum apni custom scripts bhi bana sakte hai
