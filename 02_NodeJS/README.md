ABOUT NODE JS

- node js is not a programming language
- not technology
- not framework
- not library 
thennnn what it is????

*** basically NODEJS is JAvascript runtime Environment

* JS se backend nhi ban sakta
* bcoz JS ke pass vo fnctionalities hi nahi hai jinse backend banta hai
* ryan dehl ne socha js se backend banna chahiye
* after researching this thiings, google chrome ka V8 engine ka code open source hai and ryan dahl us code mein manipulation kar rha hai
* v8 engine made in c++
* then he think that we want our code in js

* we will write js code  that will receive by the wrapper layer and that code will create server with v8 engine server modules

V8 + js wrapper layer get code = Node.js

** 
- Node js is a js runtime environment
- it gives only mahol for creating backend with js.


- NPM is like a playstore
