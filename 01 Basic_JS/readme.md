Async:-

- if our code runs line by line then its known as synchronous process

- if our code is of asynchronous nature then send that code in side stack and let the nature sync code run

whenver the full sync code runs i.e. main stack is empty then check that the async code is completed or not...
if completed then take it out in the mean stack and run it
side stack me async code process hoga execute nhi hoga
or waha process hoke vo main stack me aake execute hoga that's it

fetch()=> async in nature
